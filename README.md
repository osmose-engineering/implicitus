# Implicitus

**From Prompt to Production: A Continuous Implicit Modeling Platform**

Implicitus provides a fully implicit pipeline for manufacturing design, enabling seamless integration between text prompts, AI agents, and slicing engines—without intermediate mesh conversions.

---

## Core Capabilities

- **Text-to-Implicit Conversion**: Transform plain-language prompts into parametric implicit models via LLM integration.
- **SDF Evaluation**: Sample signed distance fields at arbitrary points with high-performance CPU and GPU kernels.
- **Native Slicing**: Generate layer contours and toolpaths directly from implicit functions, bypassing lossy mesh workflows.
- **AI Agent API**: Offer an HTTP/JSON interface for conversational model creation, sampling, slicing, and iterative refinement.
- **Extensible Schema**: Define primitives, transforms, Boolean operations, and manufacturing-aware constraints in a versioned protobuf schema, with JSON interoperability.
- **Validation Pipeline**: Ensure model correctness and manufacturability through schema enforcement and sample-based diagnostics.
- **Exporters & SDKs**: Provide G-code, CNC and robotic motion plan exporters, plus client libraries for Python and JavaScript.

**Inital Goal**  
Deliver a minimal end-to-end text→implicit→slice pipeline showcasing:

- A basic `.proto` schema for primitives and transforms.
- Core engine stub capable of loading schema and evaluating SDF at sample points.
- AI adapter stub reading prompts and generating placeholder implicit models.
- Canvas API stub with `POST /models` and `GET /models/{id}/slices?layer=` end-points.
- Example prompt and automated example script demonstrating the flow.

**Deliverables**  
- `schema/implicitus.proto` with minimal primitives.
- `core_engine` stub with SDF evaluator API.
- `ai_adapter` stub with mock LLM call.
- `canvas_api` stub server.
- `examples/hello_world.json` and placeholder slice output.
- README documenting setup and example usage.

## Getting Started

**Prerequisites**  
- Rust >=1.60 (for `core_engine`)  
- Python 3.8+ (for `ai_adapter` & examples)  
- Node.js 14+ (for `canvas_api`)  

**Setup**  
```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/your-org/implicitus.git
cd implicitus

# Build core engine
cd core_engine
cargo build

# Install Python dependencies
cd ../ai_adapter
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Install Node dependencies for API
cd ../canvas_api
npm install
```

**Running the Example**  
```bash
# From project root
make example
```

## Next Steps

- Flesh out schema with transforms and Booleans  
- Implement real LLM integration  
- Expand validation pipeline  
- Implement slice exporter
