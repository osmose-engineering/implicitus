"""Lightweight Python stub for the Rust-backed ``core_engine`` module.

This stub implements only the minimal surface area required by the tests.
It provides naive Python implementations of ``prune_adjacency_via_grid`` and
placeholders for other symbols expected by the real module.  The functions are
not optimized and should only be used in test environments where the compiled
